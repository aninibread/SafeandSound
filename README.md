The Anesthesia Gas Scavenging System (AGSS) is used to actively remove any anesthetic gas mixture used during surgeries from the operation room to prevent hazardous gas exposure to the clinicians. The flow meter of the AGSS shows the flow rate at which the anesthetic gas is collected and circulated. Hence, the flow meter needs to be monitored by the anesthesiologist constantly to ensure the flow rate is within a range that indicates no anesthetic gas leakage. Previously, the anaesthesiologist had to manually inspect the flow meter to determine the state of the gas flow rate. However, the location of the flow meter is not within the anesthesiologistâ€™s direct point of view during operations, making it difficult for the anesthesiologist to monitor the flow rate. In addition, the flow meter level is indiscernible even when the environment is properly lit up due to a dark tinting on the vial of the flow meter. These factors have been the major obstacles for the anesthesiologists to detect the gas flow rate change efficiently. The designed solution should provide the anesthesiologists with feedback when the flow meter level enters an unsafe zone. This will increase the efficacy of the operation and prevent adverse events due to hazardous gas leakage.
In this project, a AGSS flow meter monitoring device is made. It employs image detection using OpenCV.
